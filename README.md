Code to analyze kinetochore oscillations in mitosis.
This script imputs a csv file containing kinetochore distance to the spindle pole overtime, with an imaging frequency of 3s, and performs several quantifications about kinetochore oscillations (kinetochore speed, standard deviation of the position, sister kinetochores coordination)
